The compiler currently reads from stdin, to enable rapid testing.
So to use just run g2c and start typing.

To use an example do:
$> 'cat test1.g | ./g2c'

The various compilation stages will be printed to stdout and
then the outputted C code will also be written to the file 'out.c'.

After that you can compile as normal with 
$> gcc out.c -o out'
