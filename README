g2c is a compiler from a subset of the probabilistic language anglican to the language probabilistic C. For instructions about how to use the compiler consult
$> g2c --help

To compile the probabilistic C outputted you will need to point the script 'compile_probc' to an installation of probabilistic c by changing the PROBC variable.

Then, to build the compiler and build all examples, just run 'make'.

To compile some example.g file yourself, run
$> g2c -i example.g -o example.c
$> compile_probc example.c example
