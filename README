g2c is a compiler from a subset of the probabilistic language anglican to the language probabilistic C. For instructions about how to use the compiler consult
$> g2c --help

To compile the probabilistic C outputted you will need to point the script 'compile_probc' to an installation of probabilistic c by changing the PROBC variable.

Then, to build the compiler, build an example and run the example, do
$> make test1
